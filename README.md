## QUTRANPY ##

# Aim #

This program allows to perform quantum transport calculations using tight binding models with a user friendly interface


# How to install #

The program has been developed to run in Linux machines. Execute the script "install" to compile all the necesary libraries,
which will also add to your PATH the folder ../bin, where the script qutranpy is present. 


For using this program in Windows and Mac, the easiest solution is to create a virtual machine using Virtual Box, installing
a version of ubuntu in that virtual machine, and following the previous instructions.


# Capabilities #
 - Quantum transport using Landauer-Buttiker formalism in electronic systems
 - Quantum transport between normal metals and superconductors using non-equilibrium Green's functions
 - Possibility of including spin-orbit coupling, magnetism and superconductivity
 - Allows to sweep in a variety of parameters of the Hamiltonian, the length of the scattering region and the energy of the incident electron
